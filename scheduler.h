/*
This scheduler is designed to maintain 2 schedules for use by the fuel and ignition systems.
It functions by waiting for the overflow vectors from each of the timers in use to overflow, which triggers an interrupt

//Technical
Currently I am prescaling the 16-bit timers to 256. This means that the counter increments every 16us and will overflow every 1048576uS
Max Period = (Prescale)*(1/Frequency)*(2^17)
(See http://playground.arduino.cc/code/timer1)
This means that the precision of the scheduler is 16uS (+/- 8uS of target)

/Features
This differs from most other schedulers in that its calls are non-recurring (IE You schedule an event at a certain time and once it has occurred, it will not reoccur unless you explicitely ask for it)
Each timer can have only 1 callback associated with it at any given time. If you call the setCallback function a 2nd time, the original schedule will be overwritten and not occur

Timer identification
The Arduino timer3 is used for schedule 1
The Arduino timer4 is used for schedule 2
Both of these are 16-bit timers (ie count to 65536)
See page 136 of the processors datasheet: http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc2549.pdf

256 prescale gives tick every 16uS
256 prescale gives overflow every 1048576uS (This means maximum wait time is 1.0485 seconds)
